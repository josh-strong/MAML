# MAML
This repository contains files relating to my MSc Data Science research project Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Deep Learning. This thesis focused on researching MAML to solve few-shot deep learning problems.  To these ends, Iconducted a thorough literature review on deep learning and meta-learning, focusing on meta-learningalgorithms MAML and MAML++.  The project involved implementing two experimental studies using Python; a toy problem demonstrating the effectiveness of MAML in addition to implementing MAML on a computer vision problem
